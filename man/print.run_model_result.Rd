\title{Print Method for run_model_result Objects}
\usage{
\method{print}{run_model_result}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class `run_model_result`, typically returned by `run_linear_models()` when a single model is fitted.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (not used).}
}
\value{
No return value. This function is called for its side effect: printing a formatted summary to the console.
}
\description{
This method defines how objects of class `run_model_result` are printed in the console.
It displays the model formula, a tidy summary of fixed effects, and the first 10 residuals.
It also provides guidance on how to access individual components of the result.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
result <- run_linear_models(data, outcome = "y", exposure = "x")
result  # triggers this print method
}
